This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce all of the results in our paper:

D. C. Elton, Z. Boukouvalas, M. S. Butrico, M. D. Fuge, and P. W. Chung, “[Applying machine learning techniques to predict the properties of energetic materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27344-x#Sec24)”, *Scientific Reports* **8**, 9059 (2018).

notebooks are in "/notebooks/" and relevant data is in "/datasets/". Example .xyz coordinates generated for the Huang & Massa data are in /HM_all_xyz_files/

The code requires the *[Molecular Machine Learning Toolkit](https://github.com/delton137/mmltoolkit)*, which was developed in conjunction with the work in our paper.

If you use any of the code here, please cite our work.

## Data sources
Property data is publicly available and was taken from :

Huang, L. & Massa, L. Applications of energetic materials by a theoretical method (discover energetic materials by a
theoretical method). *Int. J. Ener. Mat. Chem. Prop.* **12**, 197–262 (2013)

and

Mathieu, D. Sensitivity of energetic materials: Theoretical relationships to detonation performance and molecular structure.
*Ind. & Eng. Chem. Res.* **56**, 8191–8201 (2017).

SMILES strings (available in datasets) were generated in house.
